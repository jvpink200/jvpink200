- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jvpink200
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front end development and full stack development
- ðŸŒ± I completed the MERN Full Stack program through NuCamp Coding Bootcamp and have 3+ years of software development experience with my back end language being PHP as well as knowing some SQL/MongoDb. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on amazing software projects for well funded startups or established companies to help solve real world problems.
